# Beyond nodeSelector: How Node Affinity Transforms Kubernetes Scheduling

## 📌 Introduction

When running workloads in Kubernetes, you usually don't care where a Pod runs — just that it runs. But in real-world production clusters, we often need more control over which nodes handle specific Pods. For example:

* You may want to run heavy workloads only on high-memory nodes.
* You may want to isolate dev/test workloads from production.
* You may want to ensure apps run in the same or different zones for high availability.

Kubernetes provides several ways to control Pod placement. In this blog, we'll learn about:

* `nodeSelector`
* `nodeAffinity`
* `Node anti-affinity`

---

## 🔍 What is nodeSelector?

`nodeSelector` is the simplest way to control Pod scheduling. It uses a key-value pair to match a Pod to a node with the same label.

### 📘 How It Works

Every node in Kubernetes can have labels, which are key-value pairs used to organize and select subsets of nodes. You can label nodes manually like this:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd
```

Then, in your Pod or Deployment manifest, you can use `nodeSelector` to tell Kubernetes "Only schedule this Pod on nodes where `disktype=ssd`."

### 🧪 Example: Using nodeSelector

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-on-ssd
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

✅ This Pod will only run on nodes with the label `disktype=ssd`.

### 📌 Key Properties

| Feature        | Value                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Matching Logic | Simple equality (key = value)                   |
| Operators      | Only exact match                                |
| Type           | Hard constraint - Pod stays Pending if no match |
| Use Case       | Basic static node assignment                    |

### ⚠️ Limitations of nodeSelector

* ❌ Only supports exact matches — no expressions like `NotIn`, `Exists`, etc.
* ❌ Cannot express soft preferences — it's all or nothing.
* ❌ No fallback — if no matching node is available, the Pod will stay in `Pending`.

## 🎯 What is nodeAffinity?

`nodeAffinity` is a more expressive and flexible way to match Pods with nodes.

### ⚙️ How nodeAffinity Works

Node affinity is specified under the `.spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` section of a Pod or Deployment. It lets you write rules using:

* `matchExpressions` (with operators like `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `Gt`, `Lt`)
* `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` — **Hard rule**
* `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` — **Soft rule**

It supports:

* ✅ Hard and soft constraints
* ✅ Fallback behavior if preferred nodes are unavailable

### 🧪 Hard Constraint Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-ssd
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

🔍 If no node matches, the Pod will stay in `Pending`.

### 🧪 Soft Constraint Example

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - us-east-1
```

🔍 Kubernetes will score matching nodes higher but can still schedule the Pod elsewhere if needed.

### 📌 Key Features

| Feature              | `nodeAffinity`                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Match Types          | `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `Gt`, `Lt`               |
| Hard Constraints     | `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`  |
| Soft Preferences     | `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` |
| Fallback if No Match | Yes (for preferred), No (for required)            |
| Complexity Supported | High - multi-label, multi-operator logic          |

### 🧠 When to Use Node Affinity

* When you need more than one label to match
* When your nodes are heterogeneous (hardware, zones, etc.)
* When you want preference but not strict enforcement
* When you want to avoid downtime by falling back

## 🚫 What is Node Anti-Affinity?

Node anti-affinity is the inverse of node affinity. Instead of telling Kubernetes *where* to schedule Pods, you're telling it *where not* to schedule them.

It helps:

* Prevent Pods from being scheduled on certain types of nodes
* Avoid overloading specific nodes
* Enforce production-test isolation

### 🔍 How It Works

Node anti-affinity is implemented using the same structure as node affinity — just with **inverse operators**:

* `NotIn` — avoid nodes with specific label values
* `DoesNotExist` — avoid nodes that have a specific label key

### 🧪 Example: Avoid Nodes with `tier=gold`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: avoid-gold-nodes
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: tier
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                - gold
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

✅ Pods will not be scheduled on any node labeled `tier=gold`.

### 🧪 Soft Anti-Affinity

```yaml
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 100
  preference:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: tier
      operator: NotIn
      values:
      - gold
```

Kubernetes will try to avoid `tier=gold` nodes but can schedule there if needed.

### 📌 Use Cases for Node Anti-Affinity

* 🧪 Test vs Prod Isolation
* ⚙️ Hardware Sensitivity (e.g. avoid GPU nodes)
* 🔒 Cost Control

## 🛠️ Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Zone Placement for High Availability

```yaml
matchExpressions:
- key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  operator: In
  values:
  - us-east1-a
  - us-east1-b
```

### 2. Avoid GPU Nodes for Lightweight Workloads

```yaml
matchExpressions:
- key: gpu
  operator: NotIn
  values:
  - true
```

### 3. Test vs Production Separation

Label nodes:

```bash
kubectl label node <node> environment=prod
kubectl label node <node> environment=test
```

Use affinity/anti-affinity rules to isolate workloads.

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice

### 🧱 Step 1: Label Your Nodes

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl label node <node-name> disktype=ssd
kubectl label node <node-name> environment=prod
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

### 📦 Step 2: Apply a Pod with Node Affinity

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-on-ssd
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-on-ssd.yaml
kubectl describe pod pod-on-ssd
```

### 🚫 Step 3: Anti-Affinity Example

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: environment
            operator: NotIn
            values:
            - prod
```

### 🛠️ Debugging Tips

* `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` → see "Events" for scheduling issues
* `kubectl get nodes --show-labels` → verify label existence
* Use taints/tolerations for additional control (advanced)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Choosing the right node placement strategy is crucial for optimizing reliability, performance, and cost in Kubernetes:

* Use `nodeSelector` for basic static assignments
* Use `nodeAffinity` for expressive, flexible placement logic
* Use anti-affinity to avoid co-location of conflicting workloads
